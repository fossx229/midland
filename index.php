<p>What started out over 45 years ago with a couple of guys and a truck cutting pasture sod has grown into the full-service landscape and
irrigation company, Midland Nursery.

<br /><br />

Conveniently located on Highway 55 in Buffalo, Minnesota, we provide complete landscape solutions including; design, construction,
maintenance, irrigation, retaining walls, patios, water features and
decorative lighting for both residential and commercial clients.

<br /><br />

We grow native, hardy plants suitable for USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 4 in our yard in Buffalo.

<br /><br />

These quality plants are used in our installation projects and are also available – along with flowers, herbs, pots and various garden-inspired gifts – in our garden store.

<br /><br />

We are family owned and operated and many members of our staff have been a part of the Midland family for 15, 20, even 30 years.  <br /><br />

As one of the first in the industry in our area, we are pleased to continue providing the level of service and care only achieved through years of experience and dedication.</p>
